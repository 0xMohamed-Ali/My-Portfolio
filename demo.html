        <h2><i class="fas fa-user"></i> About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-me" style="font-size:20px;"> I’m a student at the Faculty of Computers and Information Science at Minya University, and a proud member of the ALX Software Engineering program. With a strong foundation in full-stack development, I specialize in building scalable, maintainable, and high-performance applications. My academic journey has provided me with hands-on experience in software engineering, problem-solving, algorithms, and data structures. I possess a deep understanding of machine learning and data science, applying analytical methods to derive insights from complex datasets and enhance decision-making processes.

            Proficient in programming languages such as Python, C, and C#, I am also skilled in Django for web development and Java (currently learning). I am well-versed in database design, data structures and algorithms, and the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). My expertise extends to software development methodologies like Agile and version control tools like Git. I’m passionate about continuous learning and strive to create efficient, scalable, and elegant solutions to modern software challenges.
            
            Additionally, I have strong problem-solving and critical thinking abilities, which I apply to optimize algorithms and tackle real-world programming challenges. I have experience working with RESTful APIs, cloud platforms, and DevOps principles. With a solid understanding of networking concepts and system design, I am committed to building innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of the tech industry.</p>
